This note lists the features provided by this DcmsMobile Application

Release Candidate Support
-------------------------
RC support is triggered only if web.config contains the URL of the rc site. If this key is not present, there will be no trace of RC support.

The design goal was to highlight to the user that a new RC is available against the menu item which the user normally clicks on the main menu.
This should encourage the use of the RC site.

<appSettings>
  <add key="RcUrl" value="http://w8ethiopia/rctest" lockItem="true" />
</appSettings>

When the home page Home/Index.cshtml runs, it has javascript which tries to invoke the URL <RcUrl>/RcItems. This URL is implemented
in the action HomeController.RcItems. It returns an array of areas for which a release candidate is available. The array includes area name along with the URL to reach that area.

Index.cshtml normally displays a menu item corresponding to each area installed. When a response from <RcUrl>/RcItems is received, an additional release candidate link appears
against each area for which RC is available. This link, when clicked, will navigate directly to the corresponding area in the RC site.

At the bottom of the home page, a link to the RC website is displayed. This link will navigate to the home page of the RC site. This link is visible only if RcUrl was
specified in web.config.

After the home page load, this link also displays the status of the contact with the site. It starts out by saying Contacting... Once the contact is successful, this message
disappears. If there is an error, this message is replaced with the error message.


Feature Folder Support
----------------------


Pluggable Area Support
----------------------

Pluggable areas can support some well known routes which DcmsMobile will display at special positions on the menu screen.

DcmsConnect_Search. This route must accept id as the query string. It should search for id and display search results. If id is not passed, it should display the search home screen.

Diagnostics Framework
---------------------
